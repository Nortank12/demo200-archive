# About
I made this website that makes the scraped database from [demo200-scraper](https://github.com/Nortank12/demo200-scraper) browsable. I have applied some additional filtering and modified the data so it's compatible with Prisma.

The website is unfortunately down so the scraper cannot be used for now. Hopefully, the website will be live soon, but regarding the amount of spamming caused to it, it might be down for good. Luckily the last dataset I've managed to scrape contains all the posts until the day of the crash.

I'm not the maintainer of the original website nor the one who tried to spam it. I thought scraping the data and making it browsable could be a fun project and might be interesting for those, who have posted there in the past.

You can host the website yourself or visit my domain, where I have a live copy running.

# Self-hosting
Follow these steps if you want to run the app yourself. It requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) to be installed.

## Install
Install the depedencies:
```
npm install
```

## Build & Preview
First, build a production version of the app:
```
npm run build
```

Then you can preview the rendered website:
```
npm run preview
```

# Check it out online
You can visit [https://demo200.mchirdeto.hu](https://demo200.mchirdeto.hu) to browse the live version.

If the site might be down in the future, you can still download the code and run it yourself.
